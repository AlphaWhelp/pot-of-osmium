# Pot of Osmium

Pot of Osmium is used as a bucket to showcase several different projects to serve as examples and education.  The Code contained for these projects is project specific.  The licensing is not the same for every project in this repository.  Please consult the License file in the project folder root for licensing information.

If a project is actually functional, and not merely a demonstration of a certain pattern or process, it will also have its own repository.  If you wish to open up a ticket with one such project, please open it up on the dedicated project page, and not on Pot of Osmium.
